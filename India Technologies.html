    <p>IRON PILLAR OF DELHI:    The world's first iron pillar was the Iron</p> 
    <p>pillar of Delhi—erected at the time of Chandragupta II Vikramaditya</p> 
    <p>(375–413). The pillar has attracted attention of archaeologists</p> 
    <p>and materials scientists and has been called "a testament to the skill</p> 
    <p>of ancient Indian blacksmiths" because of its high resistance to corrosion.</p>

    <p>where it evolved into the pagoda, a Buddhist monument used for</p> 
    <p>enshrining sacred relics.</p>

    <p>IRON AND MERCURY COHERER: Bengali physicist Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose</p> 
    <p>announced the development of an "iron-mercury-iron coherer with</p> 
    <p>telephone detector" in a paper presented at the Royal Society, London.</p> 
    <p>He also later received U.S. Patent 755,840, "Detector for electrical</p> 
    <p>disturbances" (1904), for a specific electromagnetic receiver.</p>
