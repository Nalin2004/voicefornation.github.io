    <h1>MARKETING</h1> 
  <p> India is one of the largest consumer markets in the world,</p> 
  <p>with its population of middle-class consumers expected to reach</p> 
  <p>200 million in 2020 and 475 million in 2030. But it is a complex</p> 
  <p>and diverse consumer market, and it is vital to tailor your marketing</p> 
  <p>strategies and even your products to local preferences. In addition to</p> 
  <p>intense competition from both small and large local retailers and</p> 
  <p>international companies, you must consider the diversity of cultural</p> 
  <p>backgrounds, differing levels of wealth and sophistication, and the</p> 
  <p>sheer size of both the population and land mass.</p>
  <h1>BOROLINE</h1>
 <img src="image/12.jpg" height="300px">
<p> You would be hard-pressed to find a purse or a bathroom shelf anywhere</p> 
<p>in the state of West Bengal without the signature green metallic tube.</p> 
<p>Founded in 1929 by a Bengali merchant called Gourmohon Dutta, creating</p> 
<p>Boroline was part of his effort to start a pharmaceutical company that</p> 
<p>would help the country become more self-reliant. Ninety-one years later,</p> 
<p>hundreds of thousands of Indians still swear by this perfumed antiseptic</p> 
<p>cream.</p> 
<h1>BATA INDIA</h1>
<img src="image/13.jpg" height="300px">
<p>Most Indians swear that the brand is as Indian as butter chicken but the</p> 
<p>truth is the originally-Czech shoemaker came to India back in 1931 and set</p> 
<p>up shop on the far reaches of Kolkata, then Calcutta. But since then it has</p> 
<p>naturalised to such an extent that the town in which the company’s operations</p> 
<p>are based, Batanagar, even bears its name now. It has been the shoemakers to 
 <p>our grandparents, parents and is the brand most of us went to for our</p> 
 <p>first pair.</p>
 <h1>AMUL BUTTER</h1>
 <img src="image/14.jpg" height="300px">
 <p>Not just a lardy ingredient brand, Amul Butter, has over the years became</p> 
 <p>synonymous with pop culture in the country. The brand was created in the</p> 
 <p>1940s as a response to exploitative practices of a popular diary chain.</p> 
 <p>Amul would go on to play a major role in Operation Flood, which spurred the</p> 
 <p>growth of India’s dairy industry. And in 1966, advertising executive Sylvester</p> 
 <p>da Cunha and art director Eustace Fernandez made Amul a pop culture icon by</p> 
 <p>creating the Amul girl.</p>
 <h1>AIR INDIA<h1>
  <img src="image/15.jpg" height="300px">

 <p>Whether it was Air India, or the airline’s erstwhile domestic</p> 
 <p>carrier Indian Airlines, the brand helped generations of</p> 
 <p>Indians take to the skies. The airline can trace its history</p> 
 <p>back to 1932 when JRD Tata of the Tata Group started Tata Air</p> 
 <p>Services flying a weekly airmail between Karachi and Chennai.</p> 
 <p>It soon became Tata Airlines before changing its name to Air</p> 
 <p>India in 1946, a year before Independence. It was one of the</p> 
 <p>first airlines in Asia to have a jet aircraft in its fleet and</p> 
 <p>it is still regularly enlisted by the government to bring home</p> 
 <p>Indians stranded overseas. Its mascot, the Maharaja in</p> 
 <p>various avatars, is familiar to all Indians.</p>
