    <p> India launched a new social media campaign to amplify PM Modi's message of</p>

    <p>'Vocal For Local' and self-reliability as the country emerges from</p>

   <p>the shadows of Covid-19.The campaign 'Be Indian Buy Indian' will </p>
   <p>encourage all Indians to buy 'Made in India' products by using only some</p> 
   <p>specially curated creatives on the social media platforms. </p>
   <p> Saurabh Agarwal, director, Kamdhenu, said, “The fight against the</p> 
   <p>pandemic COVID-19 is a joint effort by the government and citizens of</p> 
   <p>the country. Kamdhenu Paints, as a responsible Indian Company has been </p>
   <p>doing its bit in contributing to the fight.</p>
   <p> Vocal for Local’ is a concept which dates back to the era of the</p> 
   <p>Swadeshi movement which stared in 1905 as part of the Indian independence</p>
   <p> movement.</p>
   <p> So ‘Vocal for Local’ would have been a brilliant strategy for some</p> 
   <p>sectors in India but definitely not in most of the sectors. While ‘Vocal</p> 
   <p>for Local’ is a great idea, we have to recognise that the realities of the</p> 
   <p>global environment have changed significantly. It is no longer possible to</p> 
   <p>create globally competitive products without access to globally competitive</p> 
   <p>resources, and without creating globally competitive synergies.</p> 
   <p> India is like the rest of the world who is certainly going through a</p> 
   <p>tough phase but will still shine due to its vast pool of educated talent.</p>
